## What is a Server?
A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers.

## Role of the Domain Name
A domain name is the address where users can access a website. It's used to find and identify computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers so we use domain names instead.

## DNS Record
In the context of www.foobar.com, 'www' is typically an A or AAAA type DNS record. It's used to point a domain or subdomain to an IP address. 

## Role of the Web Server
A web server's main role is to store and deliver web pages to clients upon request. It communicates with the client's browser and sends the requested resources along with HTTP headers.

## Role of the Application Server
An application server serves web-based applications to client devices. It performs operations such as reading and writing from a database, processing data, and more.

## Role of the Database
A database stores all the data necessary for running the website or application. It can be queried by the application server to retrieve or store data.

## Server-Client Communication
Servers communicate with client computers using various protocols. For web servers, this is typically HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) if encryption is needed.

SPOF (Single Point of Failure): This refers to a part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working. These are undesirable in any system with a goal of high availability or reliability, be it a business practice, software application, or other industrial system.

Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted): This is a period when the system (a web server in this case) is unavailable or offline. This often happens during maintenance tasks like software updates, deploying new code, etc. During this time, the server may need to be restarted causing service interruption.

Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic: This refers to a systemâ€™s inability to handle increased load. If a server receives more traffic than it can handle, it may become slow or unresponsive. To prevent this, systems can be designed to scale, either by adding more resources (scaling up), or by adding more servers (scaling out).
